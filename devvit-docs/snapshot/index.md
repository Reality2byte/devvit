# Getting started

Reddit communities are data-rich forums where people go to discuss specific topics, events, brands, products, and services. Snapshot provides access to a historical archive of Reddit public content and information, including a collection of accounts, subreddits, posts, comments, and engagement metrics. Data spanning a period of time is delivered as a bulk export rather than a stream or API service. If you are not a Snapshot client, please reach out to your Account Manager for pricing and more information.

# Data delivery

When you first sign up for Snapshot, youâ€™ll select your preferred data format (JSON or CVS) and cloud provider (Google Cloud Storage or Amazon S3).

Data is delivered in a compressed GZIP to its own directory. The directory is named in the `date=YYYY-MM-DD` format, which corresponds to the last date included in the dataset. This folder contains subdirectories for each entity:

- accounts
- comments
- posts
- subreddits

Subsequent deliveries also include additional datasets in these subdirectories for compliance purposes:

- records_to_redact
- records_to_remove

Specific directions for access to the data in Google Cloud or AWS will be provided separately.
For more information on data format, please see the [Schemas](schemas.md) and [Examples](examples.md).
