# Overview

Create live and event-driven interactive posts. Realtime provides a set of primitives that lets you build interactive posts that are:

- **Live**. Users engaging with the same interactive post see each othersâ€™ changes without any observable lag.
- **Event-driven**. Posts render automatically in response to server events.
- **Synced**. Using realtime with [Redis](../server/redis.mdx) lets you build persistent community experiences that are backed by high performance data synchronization.

Realtime is supported in both [Devvit Web](../devvit-web/devvit_web_overview.mdx) and [Devvit Blocks](../blocks/overview.md) applications.
