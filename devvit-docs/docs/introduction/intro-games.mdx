# Games on Reddit

Unleash your creativity and build engaging games inside Reddit communities with Devvit’s powerful platform.

Devvit is Reddit’s developer platform for building interactive, cross-platform games and apps that run natively on Reddit.

[Devvit Web](../capabilities/devvit-web/devvit_web_overview.mdx) lets you build Devvit apps using standard web technologies—like React, Three.js, or Phaser—so you can use familiar tools and frameworks to create games for Reddit. It supports a traditional client/server split, and makes it easy to bring modern web games to Reddit using the tools you already know.

## Why build games on Reddit?

Reddit is home to millions of communities, each with its own culture and interests. With Devvit, you can create games that:

- Bring people together for collaborative or competitive play
- Spark new kinds of interaction and fun
- Reward participation and creativity
- Reach Reddit’s massive audience
- Run natively on web, iOS, and Android
- Earn money through Reddit Gold payments and [Reddit Developer Funds](../earn-money/reddit_developer_funds.md)
