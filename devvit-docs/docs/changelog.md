# Changelog

While we're always shipping fixes and improvements, our team bundles new features, breaking changes, and other user-facing updates into regular releases. This page logs the changes to each version of Devvit.

Before upgrading `@devvit/public-api` in your project, always update the CLI first by running `npm install -g devvit`.
